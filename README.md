# Vulnerability Management Lab
Skills learned: Nessus Essentials, Vulnerability Remediation, Virtualization

<h2>Description</h2>
I followed a tutorial video found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT6Px9zJM3s">here.</a> <br/>
I worked on vulnerability scanning and vulnerability remediation, two of the main steps in the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle. I used Nessus Essentials to scan a local Windows 10 virtual machine hosted on VMware Fusion and run basic and credentialed scans to discover vulnerabilities, remediate them and then rescan to verify remediation.

<h2>Steps</h2>
To start, I installed VMware Fusion, Nessus Essentials, and dowloaded a Windows 10 ISO. I then set up my virutal machine and ensured I could ping it from my host machine. I set up the first basic network scan in Nessus, assigning the target IP address to be the VM, and ran the scan. Once I inspected the results of the scan, I had to configure some settings on the VM to allow a credentialed scan, such as enabling the remote registry service, turning on file and printer sharing, turning off user account control, and creating a registry key. After that was done, I edited the inital scan configuration to add the credentials to the VM and ran another scan. I observed the differnece in the results of the non-credentialed vs credentialed scan and then installed an old version of Mozilla Firefox on the virtual machine and ran a third scan. The scan results from that scan were filled with critical and high vulnerabilites that could be remediated by either updating or uninstalling Firefox and applying Windows updates. Once those measures were taken, I ran a final scan to confirm remediation of those vulnerabilites.
