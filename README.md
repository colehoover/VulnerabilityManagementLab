# Vulnerability Management Lab
Skills learned: Nessus Essentials, Vulnerability Remediation, Virtualization

<h2>Description</h2>
I am following a tutorial video found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT6Px9zJM3s">here.</a> <br/>
I will work on vulnerability scanning and vulnerability remediation, two of the main steps in the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle. I will use Nessus Essentials to scan local virtual machines hosted on Oracle Virtual Box and run credentialed scans to discover vulnerabilities, remediate them and then rescan to verify remediation.
